# Polygon Research
## What is Polygon?

Polygon is a secondary scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. These types of solutions work on top of an existing blockchain network rather than using their own blockchain. In this instance, Polygon works on top of Ethereum which has become slow and expensive to use as it becomes ever more popular. In other words Polygon is also referred as Ethereum internet of blockchains.

## What are the costs of using Polygon?

Gas fees on the network remain low at $0.1-0.5 which makes it really appealing for users searching for ways to avoid the expensive gas fees on the Ethereum network.

## What about its infrastructure and capabilities?

Polygon is a platform that provides hybrid Proof-of-Stake and Plasma-enabled sidechains built on Solidity with transactional throughtput ranging from 1K-10K TPS with a 2-second average block time. Polygon takes one of the first places when it comes to optimizations of Ethereum. The is a total supply of 10 billion MATIC tokens.

## What about developing on Polygon?

If you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a Polygon developer. The compatibility with Ethereum enables easy transition of users and developers to Polygon. Developers can launch their own sovereign blockchains and decentralized applications, empowered by a set of advanced modules that enable the deployment of interconnected blockchain networks, with easily customizable functionality. Polygon Edge, Polygon Hermez and many more are created from Polygon team to help developers build their Dapps in a quicker and more secure manner.


## What about Polygon's Community?

Polygon has a strong social media presence and it's recent adoption by Ethereum users looking for a cheaper solution boosted the number of active members of its community. 7000+ dApps have used Polygon to scale their performance. Major DeFi projects like Uniswap, and the world’s largest NFT marketplace, Opensea, have integrated Polygon into their platforms, and top metaverse projects like Decentraland and Sandbox have also chosen MATIC as their dedicated scaling solution.

## What about Polygon's Future?

Polygon strives to solve the scalability and usability issues while not compromising on decentralization, security and leveraging the existing developer community and ecosystem of Ethereum. The network has already surpassed its initial vision for Matic, by offering an exhaustive set of tools for developers to create high-performance, high-scaling blockchain protocols and dApps. Polygon’s dapps ecosystem went from having 30 dapps in 2020 to over 7,000 dapps in 2021. Polygon has a solid foundation and it's uniqueness could play and important role in the future when Ethereum 2.0 comes to live.

## Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Shares Ethereum developer tools
- Abundance of research - Polygon Zero in particular provides extremely-fast ZK proofs, and its technology might become the future leader for ZK rollups.
- Polygon has a fully customisable tech stack, which offers users with a similar experience to that of Ethereum
- multi-chain system allows Polygon to access and use the full power of Ethereum
- cost of deploying smart contracts - Ethereum - 0.308 ETH - $1350. <-> Polygon $0.31 5000x decrease!
  
Cons:
- Still requires the Ethereum network
- Split attention on multiple projects - crypto community doesn't know about them because there are too many to focus on.
- Centralized governance of the PoS chain
	- Governance is currently centralized.
	- The Polygon team single-handedly increased the transaction fee from 1 to 30 Gwei in Oct 2021 to combat spammers. They didn't communicate this with the community or ask for feedback ahead of time.
- Less resistant to DDoS attacks
- There is a chance that with developments in Ethereum 2.0, Polygon will no longer be required as the second layer of Ethereum

## Conclusion

Polygon Network has been an innovation on the Ethereum blockchain. The network has made it possible for protocols to scale up the Ethereum blockchain, increasing the speed of these protocols and reducing the cost. Ugrades are planned for 2022 that should help the network grow and their team has shown real progress towards their goals.
